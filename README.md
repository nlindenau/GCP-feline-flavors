# Backstory (by ChatGPT)

Once upon a time in a quaint town, there lived a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed orange Siberian cat named Eppu. Eppu wasn't your ordinary feline; he was a visionary, an entrepreneurial cat with dreams as big as his love for treats.

Eppu's days were filled with crafting the most delectable cat snacks in his cozy kitchen. His Feline Flavors Deli had become a local sensation, drawing cats from all corners of the neighborhood to indulge in his flavorful creations. Yet, Eppu harbored dreams beyond the town's borders.

One day, as Eppu basked in the sun, a thought struck him like a lightning bolt – why not share his culinary delights with cats around the world? The idea ignited a fire in his whiskers, and Eppu knew he needed more than just a chef's hat; he needed the power of technology.

Enter Google Cloud Platform, the key to Eppu's global dreams. With GCP's scalable infrastructure and advanced analytics, Eppu could manage his business seamlessly. The cloud became his kitchen assistant, helping him analyze customer preferences, streamline orders, and ensure every cat received their treats promptly.

As Eppu embraced the digital transformation, his cat snack empire began to soar. Orders poured in from distant lands, and cats everywhere reveled in the joy of Feline Flavors Deli. The heartwarming success story of a little cat with big dreams had become a worldwide sensation.

Eppu, the entrepreneurial orange Siberian cat, proved that with a sprinkle of ambition and a dash of technology, dreams could leap beyond the cozy confines of a kitchen to touch the hearts – and taste buds – of cats worldwide. And so, under the virtual canopy of the cloud, Eppu's journey continued, one paw at a time, leaving a trail of satisfied purrs in its wake.
