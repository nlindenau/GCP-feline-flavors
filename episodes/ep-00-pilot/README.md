# Episode 00 - pilot

Eppu was an orange Siberian cat with a big dream - to make the best cat snack shop the world has ever seen. He loved all kind of snacks and was very passionate about sharing his love with the world and providing all cats with the greatest bites. 

Feline Flavors Deli started small, with Eppu selling his snacks to other cats in Espoo City, but the brave orange kitty got such good feedback from customers that he got brave and wanted to expand his business and move to the digital world. Smart move!

Besides having a knack for business, Eppu was quite tech-savvy (he has spent a lot of time napping on laptops and tablets). He has researched his options and decided to go with building his business in the cloud - so he could easily scale up and match the needs of the feline fellowship worldwide. Google Cloud Platform has stood out as a cloud provider, due to clear pricing policies, broad offering and easily understandable services. Eppu was also impressed with the environmental efforts by Google Cloud, and a Low CO2 computing sounded like a responsible choice.

Being a small business owner is no easy task! But the orange feline was resourceful. He knew that balancing making snacks, marketing, customer service and building the cloud architecture would be much easier if he had others helping him on his journey. After all, life is easier with friends. He has asked you to help him with the cloud architecture - he has his vision for it, and would like you to help with the nitty-gritty details of implementing it. 

As exciting as it is to start a new project, you need to first get your setup in order! 

Before embarking on the journey to make Feline Flavors Deli greatest cat snack business, Eppu wanted you to be familiar with the general workflow of building GCP architecture with Terraform, so he prepared a very simple setup that you can try deploying yourself. 

# Theory

Google Cloud Platform is a managed cloud service provider. This means that as a user, you can create all kinds of resources there and Google takes care of hosting them. Google Cloud Platform has multiple products - which are specialized services solving technical challenges. An example of a product is Compute Engine - a Compute Engine instance is essentially a Virtual Machine in the cloud.

Think about a very typical [three layer architecture](https://www.ibm.com/topics/three-tier-architecture). Let's say you have an extremely simple web app, with a static landing page, MySQL database and Python backend. You could just create three VMs, with each VM hosting one of the layers and call it a day. But maintaining VMs is quite tedious and you could use that time for something else, like developing new features. This is where cloud services shine. You could use a Cloud Storage bucket for your frontend, Cloud SQL for the database and maybe even containerize your backend and deploy it on Cloud Run. This not only saves you time, but also allows you to take advantage of build-in features of those managed services, like autoscaling. 

There are few ways in which you can build those resources in the cloud. You can go to the GCP console and click through the menus to configure and deploy your dream database. But this is quite labor intense operation. As you create more resources, tracking them gets more complex. Now imagine your friend builds a new application, with a similar architecture to yours and asks you for your help. Will you remember all the menus you clicked through and all the settings you had configure? 

This is where Infrastructure as Code comes in handy. It allows you to declaratively describe your resources and create them in a replicable and reusable manner. For Google Cloud, Terraform is one of the IaC tools you can use. You can learn more about Terraform on Google Cloud [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/terraform). Chief Cat Engineer Eppu decided that you will use Terraform, at is a mature tool and has a gentle learning curve.

Note that this is not a Terraform-focused "course". We will use Terraform only as a tool for creating and destroying resources and the Terraform explanations will be kept minimum. You are of course welcome to study Terraform on your own!

# What do I need to do?

First of all, you need your own GCP project in which the Feline Flavors Deli resources will live in. You can use the same project for all of the episodes. To start your own project, follow the Google Cloud provided [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).

Make sure you have familiarized yourself with the requirements in the main README at the root of the repository and installed all the tools that you will need on your journey. Good preparation is pretty much half of the work done, isn't it?

Chief Cat Engineer Eppu at Feline Flavors Deli has prepared a boilerplate Terraform code for you. 
In the `main.tf` file, he has listed the Terraform providers that are needed to run the code.
In the `providers.tf` he has configured the Google provider, to let Terraform know where will the resources be deployed. 
In the `variables.tf`, he has listed the input variables that the Terraform code needs.
Finally, in `storage.tf` he has drafted the Cloud Storage resources. 
He has also described the components as comments in the code, so you could get familiar with how Terraform works on high level. üò∏

Before you will start deploying the resources, you need to authenticate yourself to Google Cloud. For now, we will use your own credentials to interact with GCP, but we will learn some alternatives later on. 

To authenticate, we will use Application Default Credentials, meaning that we will authenticate using the `gcloud` cli, store the credentials on our machine and call the GCP APIs using those credentials. 
Simply run `gcloud auth application-default login` command in your terminal and follow the interactive steps. 

If you completed the authentication successfully, we can deploy our first resource!

1. In your console, navigate inside the `terraform` folder.
2. Inspect the code in the Terraform folder and familiarize yourself with the code components.
3. [Initialize Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/init) with `terraform init`.
4. Inspect the incoming changes by running `terraform plan`. You can also learn more about the command [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/plan).
5. [Apply the changes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/apply) by running `terraform apply` to perform infrastructure changes. When prompted, type `yes`.
6. Navigate to Google Cloud Platform Console, search for `Cloud Storage` and find your newly created bucket. 

Congratulations on creating your first cloud resource and running your first terraform workflow! Chief Cat Engineer Eppu purrs happily, content with your progress. üê±‚Äçüíª

After you are done with this challenge, you can [remove your resources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/destroy) by running `terraform destroy`.
